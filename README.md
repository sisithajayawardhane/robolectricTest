Robolectric is the industry-standard unit testing framework for Android. With Robolectric, your tests run in a simulated Android environment inside a JVM, without the overhead and flakiness of an emulator. Robolectric tests routinely run 10x faster than those on cold-started emulators.

Robolectric supports running unit tests for *16* different versions of Android, ranging from Jelly Bean (API level 16) to SV2 (API level 32).

In this simple project I'm going to use this testing for a textview containing "Hello World" for a activity and a fragment.
